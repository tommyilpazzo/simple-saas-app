Demystifying SaaS app creation

Goal: Understand the steps needed to create, version, and deploy a SaaS app, including tracking the libraries it depends on so that your production and development environments are as similar as possible.

What you will do: Create a simple "hello world" app using the Sinatra framework, version it properly, and deploy it to Heroku.
